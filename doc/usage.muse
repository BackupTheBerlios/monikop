* Usage

   - You have to be able to tell from your data if it's complete.
   - Monikop shows which disks have data and therefore should be
     transferred to Pokinom.
   - Monikop keeps starting over until shutdown or until disappearance
     or data source(s)
   - Pokinom needs sufficient amount of free space on sink; must be
     rebooted once this is not the case.
   - File permissions in Destination's receiving directory must not be
     changed such that the rsync server is prevented from modifying.
     Best practice is to move them out of this directory prior to any
     processing. 
   - fsck-monikop: to be run by root
   - Backup functionality: data remains on disks until re-inserted in
     Monikop. Names in use.

* Bugs

  - Data must not contain any directories called $rsync_partial_dir_name
  - Doesn't reflect disappearance of files on sources
  - May ignore empty dirs (really?)
